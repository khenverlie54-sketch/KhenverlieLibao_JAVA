ABOUT THE PROGRAM

This program is a simple Order Management System written in Java. It simulates an online store that creates and manages orders using abstraction, encapsulation, enums, and collections.

What the Program Does

- Uses an abstract 'Order' class to define order behavior  
- Uses 'OrderStatus' enum to manage order states  
- Implements a 'Payable' interface to handle payment  
- Creates 'OnlineOrder' objects and stores them in an ArrayList  
- Traverses orders using an Iterator  
- Displays order summaries and removes cancelled orders  

Packages & Classes Used

- 'order.OrderStatus' – enum representing order state  
- 'order.Order' – abstract class defining order behavior  
- 'order.OnlineOrder' – concrete class implementing payment and order processing  
- 'payment.Payable' – interface for payment behavior  
- 'main.OrderApp' – contains the main method and manages orders  

Java Concepts Used
