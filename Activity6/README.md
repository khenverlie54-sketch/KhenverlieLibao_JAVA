ABOUT THE PROGRAM

This program is a Smart Home Management System written in Java. It models different smart home devices using inheritance and polymorphism, allowing multiple devices to be managed using a common parent class.

What the Program Does

- Creates different device objects: Air Conditioner, Lamp Shade, Television, and Microwave  
- Uses method overriding to show device-specific status information  
- Uses a Device array to store all devices and control them together  
- Turns devices ON/OFF using static methods  
- Counts how many devices are currently powered on  

Classes Used

- Device – base class with common device behavior  
- AirConditioner, LampShade, Television, Microwave – subclasses with specific features  
- SmartHomeSystem – contains the main method and demonstrates the system  

Java Concepts Used

Inheritance, method overriding, polymorphism, static methods, encapsulation, arrays, and runtime polymorphism.
