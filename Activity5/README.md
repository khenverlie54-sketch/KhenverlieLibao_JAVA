ABOUT THE PROGRAM

This program is a **School Management System** written in Java. It models people and resources in a school using **inheritance** and **aggregation**, following real-world relationships between students, teachers, and courses.

What the Program Does

* Creates a base 'Person' class for common attributes
* Uses inheritance to define 'Student' and 'Teacher' as specialized types of 'Person'
* Uses aggregation to allow a 'Teacher' to handle one or more 'Course' objects 'k'
* Displays detailed information for students and teachers along with their courses

Classes Used

* 'Person' – base class containing common personal information
* 'Student' – inherits from 'Person' and represents a student
* 'Teacher' – inherits from 'Person' and manages multiple courses
* 'Course' – represents a course handled by a teacher
